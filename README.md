# ReceiptReaderMaven - FOR PERSONAL USE/UPLOAD
Upload/back of a personal program that uses the asprise ocr api services(http://asprise.com/receipt-ocr-data-capture-api/extract-text-reader-scanner-index.html - some code is copied from here as per the instructions online) to scan a reciept, return the date, and print it. To be worked on & updated - 5/30/2022

Since the IntelliJ maven project couldn't uplaoded due to size, I uploaded the code and jpg which can be reopened and run in a any/new Maven project with the files in this repository pasted/copied to the src/main/java directory.
